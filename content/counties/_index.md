<h5>County Fact Sheets for All 3,122 U.S. Counties</h5>


These County Fact Sheets are two-page economic and social snapshots of every U.S. county. They use data from two of my research papers (<a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~yagan/Hysteresis.pdf" target="_blank">Employment Hysteresis from the Great Recession</a> and <a href="https://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/coll_mrc_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility</a>), two of my coauthors' research papers (<a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/healthineq_summary.pdf" target="_blank">Association between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014</a> and <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/atlas_paper.pdf" target="_blank">The Opportunity Atlas: Mapping the Childhood Roots of Social Mobility</a>), and direct data downloads from government agencies. The underlying data sources are Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau, National Center for Education Statistics, FBI Uniform Crime Reports, Internal Revenue Service, and the Centers for Disease Control.
