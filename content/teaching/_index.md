### **Undergraduate Public Sector Economics**
This course (Berkeley Economics 131) analyzes the role of the government in the economy. The aim is to provide an understanding of the reasons for government intervention in the economy, the benefits and costs of possible government policies, and the responses of economic agents to the government's actions. The course covers tax policy and inequality, social insurance programs, public goods, environmental protection, and the interaction between different levels of government. Special emphasis is on current policy issues such as tax reform, budget deficits, and health care reform.
